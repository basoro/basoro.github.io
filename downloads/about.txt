Installation Notes: 
1, you can choose one or more PHP versions to install, if you choose 7 or 8, you can choose the PHP version when creating a website 
2. If it is not necessary, it is not recommended to install MySQL5.7. 
3. The integrated environment of this panel is the source installation mode. The installation process may take 40-300 minutes depending on the performance of the server. 
4. If you have chosen a single PHP version, add the PHP version with the following command if needed: sh /www/server/install.sh add 
5. If you find that you have selected the wrong MySQL version after compiling, you do not need to reinstall it. You can recompile MySQL by the following command: sh /www/server/install.sh mysql 
6. If you interrupt SSH during the installation process, you do not need to reinstall after reconnecting. Enter screen -r bt to restore the previous installation process. 
7, if you want to add plug-ins to PHP or Nginx, you need to use the compiled package, you can find the compiled package in the src directory under the corresponding installation directory.

Integrated WEB panel: 
We have integrated a very useful set of panels, using the following methods:

Initialization: The first use will require initial configuration. Please follow the prompts to fill in the configuration information. Login: Use the account and password to fill in the initial configuration. Login panel function: website management, FTP management, database management, file management, firewall management
